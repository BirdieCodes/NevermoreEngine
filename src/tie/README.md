Tie allows interfaces to be defined between Lua OOP and Roblox objects. This is designed in part to replace BinderGroups, which were a way to previously allow systems to interface with each other in a generic way. Instead, an object may implement a TieInterface, which is basically bindable functions/events.

## Installation
```
npm install @quenty/tie --save
```

## Design philosophy
This package does two things. First of all, it basically automates the creation of interfaced definitions, that is, tying a Lua object to BindableEvent/BindableFunction definitions. Second of all, it lets objects be centralized as an interface definition.
